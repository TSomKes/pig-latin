# pig-latin
Toy app for translating text into Pig Latin

## Origin & intent
My young daughter likes playing wit Pig Latin, and this seemed like something
she'd enjoy "testing" for me :).

This is meant to be a learning experience for me:  Working more publicly in
github, playing with Python (esp. unit testing), etc.

A little write-up of my experience is available <a
href="http://tsomkes.com/pig_latin_app/">here</a>.

## Disclaimers
This is /not/ meant to be a useful utility, though in time it might drift in
that direction.

Also, I am not a linguist, a philologist, or anything of the sort.  This app
will definitely make some naive mistakes.  (I plan to wave all that away by
claiming this is a "toy"...)
