# pig-latin
Toy app for translating text into Pig Latin

## Origin & intent
My young daughter likes playing wit Pig Latin, and this seemed like something
she'd enjoy "testing" for me :).

This is meant to be a learning experience for me:  Working more publicly in
github, playing with Python (esp. unit testing), etc.

This is /not/ meant to be a useful utility, though in time it might drift in
that direction.
